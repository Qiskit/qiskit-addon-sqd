deprecations:
  - |
    The ``addressess`` positional argument to :func:`qiskit_addon_sqd.fermion.solve_fermion` and :func:`qiskit_addon_sqd.optimize_orbitals` has been deprecated in favor of ``bitstring_matrix``. Users are no longer required to convert their configuration to determinant addresses; instead, they should now pass in the bitstring matrix specifying the subspace onto which to project and diagonalize the Hamiltonian. The conversion to determinant addresses will be done internally.
