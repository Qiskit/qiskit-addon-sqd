fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue affecting open-shell workflows which caused the output of :func:`qiskit_addon_sqd.fermion.flip_orbital_occupancies` to be ordered as ``[occ_a_N, ..., occ_a_0, occ_b_N, ..., occ_b_0]`` instead of the correct ``[occ_b_N, ..., occ_b_0, occ_a_N, ..., occ_a_0]``. Users should no longer flip the orbital occupancies output from :func:`qiskit_addon_sqd.fermion.solve_fermion`; they will be output in the correct order (the same order as the bitstrings).
